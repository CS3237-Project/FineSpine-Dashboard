Portfolio item showing the use of React, React Router, Bootstrap, and Chart.js.

This project shows how component composability can increase consistency and help you write less code. Notice every widget wraps the generic "Widget" component which takes care of loading and error states out of the box.

Other technologies used: Sass, Webpack (with Create React App), Git, and Netlify for deployment.
